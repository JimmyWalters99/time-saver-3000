**The Big Idea:** 
The general idea for this project is a search tool for downloaded and online class content. Users will be able to easily search any files and webpages they want easily. This is intended mainly for students. We will explore text file scanning, and the challenge of needing to build/index a database, and gui design. We will generate an easy to use product where users can drag and drop files into the application and submit links. Then, the program will run a keyword search on the relevant class topic. For example, a student will upload all class slides and web articles the professor has provided, then be able to save this group of content and come back to it and search it easily for keywords. The minimum viable product would be a simple powerpoint scanning tool which would still be useful. The stretch goal would be to simply link a canvas website to the program and be able to download all related files and search the entire canvas site without any need for the user to manually upload the files to the program. 

**Learning Goals:** 
I want to learn how to code better during the course of this project, but primarily, better at learning how to code. I think projects like this can be really useful tools to see how well you can learn from certain resources, so it gives you a lot of feedback in understanding how to answer you question, and also sometimes how to even ask your questions. In terms of my team, I want to learn better organizational skills, I also want to learn how to communicate with my team better through slack and learn how to use github to work together well. 

**Project Schedule** 
The first week will be dedicated to research about the resources and tools we will need to get comfortable using. The second through 3 week I imagine we will be working on the file reader and url reader, then the next two weeks will be dedicated to finding out ghow to store them in a database. The last few weeks will be debugging and gui design hopefully, I do not have a very solid understanding of this project schedule. 

**Collaboration Plan** 
I assume we will code together in pairs because we have a larger team than usual, and we can split into even pairs of two. Then the two pairs will integrate their code together. This is going to be better for us because it is very easy to meet with one person, and two brains are better than one. We are all relatively novice coders so this project will be a challenge for us, but I'm confident in our abilities to be agile and develop something we are proud of. 

**Risks** 
This project subject may end up being very difficult to implement based on our coding backgrounds, but I think we can meet the bare minimum and still develop a useful program that will help students. 

**Additional Course Content** 
The GUI design content will defiently be really helpful for our team to make a polished looking program. Additionally, I imagine some of the most important content wil be the debugging resources and skills that we learn along the way.
